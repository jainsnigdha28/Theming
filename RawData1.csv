"Recognition, praise, appreciation, gratitude and flexibility: These are just a few ways to make your work force happier and more productive.employees:    Appreciate your employees by recognizing their accomplishments with praise and appreciation.  Don't wait for reviews or evaluations to praise your workers.  Show employees you care by paying attention to their daily work and achievements.  Show your appreciation when they are working particularly hard.  You can never say “thank you” too often.  Know your employees and coworkers by name.  Be involved – say hello, ask them about their weekends, families, etc.  Socialization is a key factor for happiness. The more fun and social your workplace is, the happier your employees will be.  Don't micromanage your employees. It lowers motivation and the overall morale of the department.  Free time can be even more important that money or raises. Motivate your employees by offering a paid day off or a more flexible schedule.  Workers are happier when their basic needs are met, so support health and wellness initiatives at work.  A healthy environment includes good lighting, plenty of natural sunlight, plants, plenty of fresh water, etc.  Allow your workers to take shorts breaks where they can get up, stretch and take a break from the computer so they can refresh. This in turn will help improve their creativity and productivity.  Encourage vacations. Workers will return happier, refreshed and motivated.  Have weekly meetings to discuss good news. Most meetings go over what's missing or bad events – switch it up by holding meetings to share the positive news.

"Commit to paying every employee a living wage. To see examples of how much that is, depending on where you live, go to this site. Many companies do not meet that standard for many of their jobs. It’s nothing short of obscene to pay a CEO millions of dollars a year while paying any employee a sum for full time work that falls below the poverty line.  Give all employees a stake in the company’s success, in the form of profit sharing, or stock options, or bonuses tied to performance. If the company does well, all employees should share in the success, in meaningful ways.  Design working environments that are safe, comfortable and appealing to work in. In offices, include a range of physical spaces that allow for privacy, collaboration, and simply hanging out.  Provide healthy, high quality food, at the lowest possible prices, including in vending machines.  Create places for employees to rest and renew during the course of the working day and encourage them to take intermittent breaks. Ideally, leaders would permit afternoon naps, which fuel higher productivity in the several hours that follow.  Offer a well equipped gym and other facilities that encourage employees to move physically and stay fit. Provide incentives for employees to use the facilities, including during the work day as a source of renewal.  Define clear and specific expectations for what success looks like in any given job. Then, treat employees as adults by giving them as much autonomy as possible to choose when they work, where they do their work, and how best to get it accomplished.  Institute two-way performance reviews, so that employees not only receive regular feedback about how they’re doing, in ways that support their growth, but are also given the opportunity to provide feedback to their supervisors, anonymously if they so choose, to avoid recrimination.  Hold leaders and managers accountable for treating all employees with respect and care, all of the time, and encourage them to regularly recognize those they supervise for the positive contributions they make.  Create policies that encourage employees to set aside time to focus without interruption on their most important priorities, including long-term projects and more strategic and creative thinking. Ideally, give them a designated amount of time to pursue projects they’re especially passionate about and which have the potential to add value to the company.  Provide employees with ongoing opportunities and incentives to learn, develop and grow, both in establishing new job-specific hard skills, as well as softer skills that serve them well as individuals, and as managers and leaders.  Stand for something beyond simply increasing profits. Create products or provide services or serve causes that clearly add value in the world, making it possible for employees to derive a sense of meaning from their work, and to feel good about the companies for which they work.","Equal Pay and Benefits, Sharing of profits"

"1.A  Good Team with unified Vision/ Strategy & Tactical Plans.  ( From Unit Head to Loader Operator must be clear that what is today's target production and how it is to be achieved. Very specific say the loader operator must know how many Trips of Hywa has to be excavated , for which what fuel is required and how many hours are required for achieving the set target.) As clarity of thought provides actionable plans.which can overcome constraints of resources. But over stretching of target without considering limitation causes frustration and reduces Happiness. In our organizations rarely the targets reach the ultimate doer ""our workmen"" about what strategy we have , for them everyday is old routine mechanical exercise, without ""CONNECT"" no motivation, challenge, excitement , joys of victory and pains of failure.
2. Focus Must Not Be ""To make Wrong Right , But Make Strong Bright"", This small mantra will have paradigm shift in approach and optimize resources and thereby increase productivity with minimum efforts. ( In past 9 years I have found in a year there are only one or two occasions when we break our production records of previous year say highest ever dispatch in a month or day. But these are occasional we never analyze in-spite of existing constraints of resources . What went right ? What strength we relied upon to break all previous records ? What were the Enablers ? so that this achievement could be turned into usual practice. But our organization never introspects this rather the achievement is soon forgotten after a sumptuous partying and probable cash incentives to employees involved. Then begins the 363 days of usual productions fighting with constraints, rectifying faults and similar activities. Forgetting that on that eventful day in-spite of all errors, all constraints we achieved our best. If we can introspect our strengths , we can be assured that what ever be the market conditions, heavy taxation, Government Policy, we will survive all odds with best optimized cost.",team work to achieve Vision/ Strategy

"The source of happiness is the mind that directs a person to be happy even in circumstances that are difficult and obstacles that may seem insurmountable to some. It is rightly said that happiness is a state of mind.   The people who manage to stay happy despite calamity are the ones who have most of the following traits.    Contentment: The first rule to stay happy is to be content with whatever life gives you. One may be ambitious and put in great efforts but satisfaction at the end of the activity must be there. It is soothing and inspires a person to struggle.    Will power: An indomitable will power will encourage the person to find a way even at places where there will be none.    Positive outlook: A person with positive outlook will always look for constructive plans rather than destructive ones. To construct something anew is anyways an inspiring activity which gains appreciation from society and instills confidence in the person.    Passion: To move in a direction in which one is passionate is itself soothing. When way to destination itself becomes enjoyable, destination is not far away. Happiness, in this case, lies not only in destination but journey itself.    Therefore, though circumstances may be difficult, certain inherent qualities in a human being make him go past all difficulties. It is rightly said- Adversities cause some men to break and some to break records.",N.A.

"1. Appreciate your employees    Most managers make the mistake of waiting for annual reviews when it comes to judging the potential of their employees. The long wait for recognition makes the performing employee impatient, making way for negativity which ultimately results in reduced productivity.    It's recommended you do your best to appreciate your employees as often as you can. This will boost morale, invoking a positive environment and will help them to stay happy.    2. Be flexible    Running an office with a tight schedule with no breaks may be a mistake and a factor in making employees miserable.    It takes guts to promote a flexible standard and the future demands it. Flexible hours allows employees to have more control on their work-life balance. It’s unfair to expect workers to perform better if they are unable to give time to their families. For a careful work-life balance, it is essential to allow workers to have flexible working hours along mixed with short breaks.    If the employees are able to maintain a positive work-life balance and are able to refresh their minds as often as they need, they will start loving their office and promote towards its growth.    3. Happiness is contagious    Happiness is not a solitary experience. What can be the best way to make everyone happy other than a smile? If the boss is smiling, and positive, employees will feel relaxed, communicate more, worry less about making mistakes and ultimately learn more.    When you have a boss with a positive demeanor, the employees will start helping each other, remain healthy, communicate freely, engage in more productive talks leading to an improved work environment.    4. Promote organization    Disorganization exacerbates bad feelings and clutters the mind. It is essential to remain organized to promote a healthy workplace. Here are some ways to make it happen:    Keep the floors dry and clean to prevent falls.  Ensure to clean the washrooms and floors with disinfectants to prevent the spread of germs.  Maintain essential light levels and sufficient availability of fresh air.  Ask your employees to take care of their workspace.   5. Be a team player    Leading by example makes for a great boss. Be there for your employees when they need you most, which could mean jumping in and getting your hands dirty with them.    Rewarding your team for their hard work is a great way to raise morale. Have a strategic reward system in place based on four key areas: accountability, individual performance, team performance and punctuality.    Rewards don’t have to be monetary, either. Here are some examples:    Give an extra day off.  Throw an office party.  Give them gift cards.  Write them a [handwritten] thank you note.  6. Promote a social workplace    Offices shouldn't feel stuffy and too serious. The manager should be responsible for promoting a social workplace where workers are free to talk, share their opinions and communicate freely.    It is recommended to hold weekly meetings and discuss positive goal achievement and good things happening with your team. Motivational acknowledgment coupled with stats on positive company growth creates a virtual aura of satisfaction in the minds of the workers making them more productive.",Reward and recognition

"Recognition, praise, appreciation, gratitude and flexibility: These are just a few ways to make your work force happier and more productive.employees:    Appreciate your employees by recognizing their accomplishments with praise and appreciation.  Don't wait for reviews or evaluations to praise your workers.  Show employees you care by paying attention to their daily work and achievements.  Show your appreciation when they are working particularly hard.  You can never say “thank you” too often.  Know your employees and coworkers by name.  Be involved – say hello, ask them about their weekends, families, etc.  Socialization is a key factor for happiness. The more fun and social your workplace is, the happier your employees will be.  Don't micromanage your employees. It lowers motivation and the overall morale of the department.  Free time can be even more important that money or raises. Motivate your employees by offering a paid day off or a more flexible schedule.  Workers are happier when their basic needs are met, so support health and wellness initiatives at work.  A healthy environment includes good lighting, plenty of natural sunlight, plants, plenty of fresh water, etc.  Allow your workers to take shorts breaks where they can get up, stretch and take a break from the computer so they can refresh. This in turn will help improve their creativity and productivity.  Encourage vacations. Workers will return happier, refreshed and motivated.  Have weekly meetings to discuss good news. Most meetings go over what's missing or bad events – switch it up by holding meetings to share the positive news.

The more fun and social your workplace is, the happier your employees will be.  Don't micromanage your employees. It lowers motivation and the overall morale of the department.  Free time can be even more important that money or raises. Motivate your employees by offering a paid day off or a more flexible schedule.  Workers are happier when their basic needs are met, so support health and wellness initiatives at work.  A healthy environment includes good lighting, plenty of natural sunlight, plants, plenty of fresh water, etc.  Allow your workers to take shorts breaks where they can get up, stretch and take a break from the computer so they can refresh. This in turn will help improve their creativity and productivity.  Encourage vacations. Workers will return happier, refreshed and motivated.  Have weekly meetings to discuss good news.

"You know those little things that make your day shine and are not really connected to you in any way? Either your colleague’s attitude, the way your work space is organised or random surprises that your colleagues treat you with can make every day at work more and more enjoyable.    Little things that make people feel happy at work       1.Sociable colleagues  Isn’t everything better when you have nice sociable colleagues to work with?    2. Doing tasks that have meaning for me  Let’s say you ch1oose a job just for paying your rent and you’re waiting for a dream job opportunity. But, whatever you’re doing you want to be appreciated for your work. And how can we judge a fish by its climbing skills? We can’t.    3. Constructive feedback  The most important part of your work is feedback. No matter if it’s positive or negative (and then you will know what you have to change) feedback represents a very important instrument for measuring the quality of your work. And a complete feedback that has only the best intentions can transform your day in a very productive and cheerful one.    4. Smiling co-workers  A smile never cost anybody anything and a day seems to go better when you are surrounded by colleagues that smile and are willingly to help you anytime or just to hug you when you are not feeling ok.1    5. Having a mentor  Not anybody can brag about having a mentor at their job. A mentor is not only a teacher, it is the person that inspires you, the person from whom you want “steal” the knowledge’s of the job or you want to enjoy his “success secrets”.    6. A good training program  We all feel very motivated do our job the best way we can when we have a very good training program. Thereby you can receive better feedback  you can work more focused and you can improve your skills when you know you’ll be rewarded.    7. Brainstorming sessions  The sessions where we put our brains to work to come up with a mountain of ideas in which there is hidden, like a treasure, a brilliant idea for a project are relaxing and exhausting. Even though it seems a paradox a brainstorming session can bring up to the surface all the creativity that we are capable.","Mentor Program, More constructive Feedback, Brainstorming Sessions"

*school fees
*entertainment costs
For eg, a certain amount for good living in Noida/Greater Noida may not be enough for South Delhi.

As per our present policy all monitory benifits are equal from S1 to S7 so, while giving promotion something will be given as additional then only the employee can feel its a promotion.

2. Do not give incriment as percentage wise it will increse the parity between employees

for eg. 
assume salary of two employees 10000 and  1000  they will get 20 % of increment per year 

after 5 yeras their salary will be as under

"1. Appreciate your employees    Most managers make the mistake of waiting for annual reviews when it comes to judging the potential of their employees. The long wait for recognition makes the performing employee impatient, making way for negativity which ultimately results in reduced productivity.    It's recommended you do your best to appreciate your employees as often as you can. This will boost morale, invoking a positive environment and will help them to stay happy.    2. Be flexible    Running an office with a tight schedule with no breaks may be a mistake and a factor in making employees miserable.    It takes guts to promote a flexible standard and the future demands it. Flexible hours allows employees to have more control on their work-life balance. It’s unfair to expect workers to perform better if they are unable to give time to their families. For a careful work-life balance, it is essential to allow workers to have flexible working hours along mixed with short breaks.    If the employees are able to maintain a positive work-life balance and are able to refresh their minds as often as they need, they will start loving their office and promote towards its growth.    3. Happiness is contagious    Happiness is not a solitary experience. What can be the best way to make everyone happy other than a smile? If the boss is smiling, and positive, employees will feel relaxed, communicate more, worry less about making mistakes and ultimately learn more.    When you have a boss with a positive demeanor, the employees will start helping each other, remain healthy, communicate freely, engage in more productive talks leading to an improved work environment.    4. Promote organization    Disorganization exacerbates bad feelings and clutters the mind. It is essential to remain organized to promote a healthy workplace. Here are some ways to make it happen:    Keep the floors dry and clean to prevent falls.  Ensure to clean the washrooms and floors with disinfectants to prevent the spread of germs.  Maintain essential light levels and sufficient availability of fresh air.  Ask your employees to take care of their workspace.   5. Be a team player    Leading by example makes for a great boss. Be there for your employees when they need you most, which could mean jumping in and getting your hands dirty with them.    Rewarding your team for their hard work is a great way to raise morale. Have a strategic reward system in place based on four key areas: accountability, individual performance, team performance and punctuality.    Rewards don’t have to be monetary, either. Here are some examples:    Give an extra day off.  Throw an office party.  Give them gift cards.  Write them a [handwritten] thank you note.  6. Promote a social workplace    Offices shouldn't feel stuffy and too serious. The manager should be responsible for promoting a social workplace where workers are free to talk, share their opinions and communicate freely.    It is recommended to hold weekly meetings and discuss positive goal achievement and good things happening with your team. Motivational acknowledgment coupled with stats on positive company growth creates a virtual aura of satisfaction in the minds of the workers making them more productive.",Reward and recognition

Know your employees and coworkers by name.  Be involved – say hello, ask them about their weekends, families, etc.  Socialization is a key factor for happiness. The more fun and social your workplace is, the happier your employees will be.  Don't micromanage your employees. It lowers motivation and the overall morale of the department.  Free time can be even more important that money or raises. Motivate your employees by offering a paid day off or a more flexible schedule.  Workers are happier when their basic needs are met, so support health and wellness initiatives at work.  A healthy environment includes good lighting, plenty of natural sunlight, plants, plenty of fresh water, etc.  Allow your workers to take shorts breaks where they can get up, stretch and take a break from the computer so they can refresh. This in turn will help improve their creativity and productivity.  Encourage vacations. Workers will return happier, refreshed and motivated.  Have weekly meetings to discuss good news.

"You know those little things that make your day shine and are not really connected to you in any way? Either your colleague’s attitude, the way your work space is organised or random surprises that your colleagues treat you with can make every day at work more and more enjoyable.    Little things that make people feel happy at work       1.Sociable colleagues  Isn’t everything better when you have nice sociable colleagues to work with?    2. Doing tasks that have meaning for me  Let’s say you ch1oose a job just for paying your rent and you’re waiting for a dream job opportunity. But, whatever you’re doing you want to be appreciated for your work. And how can we judge a fish by its climbing skills? We can’t.    3. Constructive feedback  The most important part of your work is feedback. No matter if it’s positive or negative (and then you will know what you have to change) feedback represents a very important instrument for measuring the quality of your work. And a complete feedback that has only the best intentions can transform your day in a very productive and cheerful one.    4. Smiling co-workers  A smile never cost anybody anything and a day seems to go better when you are surrounded by colleagues that smile and are willingly to help you anytime or just to hug you when you are not feeling ok.1    5. Having a mentor  Not anybody can brag about having a mentor at their job. A mentor is not only a teacher, it is the person that inspires you, the person from whom you want “steal” the knowledge’s of the job or you want to enjoy his “success secrets”.    6. A good training program  We all feel very motivated do our job the best way we can when we have a very good training program. Thereby you can receive better feedback  you can work more focused and you can improve your skills when you know you’ll be rewarded.    7. Brainstorming sessions  The sessions where we put our brains to work to come up with a mountain of ideas in which there is hidden, like a treasure, a brilliant idea for a project are relaxing and exhausting. Even though it seems a paradox a brainstorming session can bring up to the surface all the creativity that we are capable.","Mentor Program, More constructive Feedback, Brainstorming Sessions"

*cost of owning a flat/Rents
*school fees
*entertainment costs
For eg, a certain amount for good living in Noida/Greater Noida may not be enough for South Delhi.

* Check that employees are availing all their leaves/ensure that employees take all their leaves
* Employees working on holidays/if yes compensate them with leaves or make all Saturdays off for them.

"1. we (S1 to S7) are getting promotions / grade change in every 3-4 years. while giving promotion some additional benefifit may be given otherthan normal as we dont have any designation change ie joining as executive and after 20-25 yeras retiring as Sr. executive.
As per our present policy all monitory benifits are equal from S1 to S7 so, while giving promotion something will be given as additional then only the employee can feel its a promotion.

2. Do not give incriment as percentage wise it will increse the parity between employees

for eg. 
assume salary of two employees 10000 and  1000  they will get 20 % of increment per year 

after 5 yeras their salary will be as under

 1.    10,000   to   Rs. 24883
